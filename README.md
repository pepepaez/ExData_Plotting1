## Instructions

The files included in this branch are:

1. project_requirements.md - Original project requirements, please read this document to understand details behind the analysis
2. getData.R - Used to fetch data from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository in case it doesn't exist, it will also subset per the requirements in the project (only 2007-02-01 and 2007-02-02) and create a separate file to be used by the plot scripts
3. plot1.R to plot4.R - Source getData.R and create plots per the requirements in the project.

Each script will create the plot in a device specifically called on the script, this means the plot will not be presented on the screen but will be saved directly on the working directory.
